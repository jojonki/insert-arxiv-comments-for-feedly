# Insert arXiv Comments for Feedly
Wen we read arXiv papers on an rss reader (feedly), we could not see paper's comments since arXiv's rss does not contain them.
However, arXiv's comments have useful information such as conference information. So this chrome extension retrieve the information, and insert the comments on your feedly. See the below green line!
